# Behavioral Patterns

* The behavioral patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
* The behavioral patterns are about communication between separate objects and they specify how separate objects interact.
* The behavioral patterns describe the ways objects and classes interact and divide responsibilities among themselves.

## See it in Action:

* Chain of Responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
* Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
* Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
* Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
* Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
* [Observer](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/behavioral/observer) - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
* [Strategy](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/behavioral/strategy) - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
