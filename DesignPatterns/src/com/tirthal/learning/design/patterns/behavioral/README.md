Behavirol Patterns
==================
* Deals with how classes and objects interact and distribute responsibility
* Behavioral patterns focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They address object or class patterns as well as the communication patterns between them. 
	- A behavioral class pattern uses inheritance to distribute behavior among classes. 
	- In contrast, a behavioral object pattern uses object composition.

Following are behavirol patterns. Click below url to learn further.
* Chain of Responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
* Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
* Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
* Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
* Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
* Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
* Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
