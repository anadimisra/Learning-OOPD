Creational Patterns
===================
* Involves object instantiation and also provide a way to decouple a client from the objects it needs to instantiate.
* Used to construct objects such that they can be decoupled from their implementing system.
* A creational pattern abstracts the process of instantiation, separating how objects are created, composed, and represented from the code that relies on them. 
* This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. 
	- Class creational patterns use inheritance to vary the classes that are instantiated.
	- Object creational patterns delegate instantiation to other objects.
	
Following are creational patterns. Click below url to learn further.
* Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
* Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Object Pool - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
* Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* [Singleton](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/creational/singleton) - A class of which only a single instance can exist per system
