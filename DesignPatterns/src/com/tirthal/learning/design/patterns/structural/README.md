# Structural Patterns

* The structural patterns are used to define structures of objects and classes that can work together, and to define how the relations can be established between entities.
* The structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure, for example using inheritance and composition, to create a large object from small objects.
* The structural patterns use composition to merge objects and classes into larger structures; and help to guarantee that when one of the parts changes, the entire structure does not need to change.

## See it in Action:

* [Adapter](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/structural/adapter) - Match interfaces of different classes
* [Bridge](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/structural/bridge) - Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
* [Composite](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/structural/composite) - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* [Decorator](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/structural/decorator) - Add additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
* Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Proxy - An object representing another object
* Private Class Data - Restricts accessor/mutator access
