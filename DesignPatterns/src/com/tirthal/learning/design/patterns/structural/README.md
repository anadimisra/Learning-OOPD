Structural Patterns
===================
* Lets you compose classes or objects into larger structures.
* A structural pattern teaches us how to compose classes and objects to form larger structures. 
	- A structural class pattern relies on inheritance to compose a resulting interface or implementation (for example, multiple inheritance mixes two or more classes into one class). 
	- A structural object pattern composes various objects to obtain new functionality.
	
Following are structural patterns. Click below url to learn further.
* Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
* Bridge - Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
* Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* [Decorator] (https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/structural/decorator) - Add additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
* Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Private Class Data - Restricts accessor/mutator access
* Proxy - An object representing another object
