# Learn Design Patterns

This project contains sample java code (by practical examples along with easy to understand comments) to learn design patterns.

## How to use this project?

Just import this project in Eclipse as an "Existing Maven Project". If require, do necessary configuration to fix build path errors (e.g. setup JRE 1.8).

## Motive

Lastly in year 2005, I read "Head First Design Patterns" book and then I consider patterns usage in coding as and when required.

Again I thought to revise my design patterns knowledge in chunks by 2016 year, and this project would be consequence of it.

I consider to take some content from below resources for the quick reference, so credit goes to authors of "SourceMaking Site", "OODesign Site" and "Design Patterns DZone Refcard".

Additionally, I intend to implement some of java code examples based on my experience.


## Design Patterns

* are recurring solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development.
* are just a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations, so can't be transformed directly into code.
* can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
* allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions.
* allow you to get experience reuse, instead of code reuse.

Patterns can be categorized under the following heads based on Scope.

 * Class - Deals with class relationships that can be changed at compile time.
 * Object - Deals with object relationships that can be changed at runtime.

The are generally categorized as following.

## Creational Patterns

Focuses on object instantiation. Let you construct objects such that they can be decoupled from their implementing system. [Start exploring creation patterns](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/creational),

* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Factory Method
* Object Pool
* Prototype
* [Singleton](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/creational/singleton)

## Structural Patterns

Focuses on the relationship of classes structure. Let you ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities. [Start exploring structural patterns](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/structural),

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* [Decorator](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/structural/decorator)
* Facade
* Flyweightg
* Private Class Data
* Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

Focuses on the communication between objects. Let you manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects. [Start exploring behavioral patterns](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/behavioral),

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Null Object
* [Observer]((https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/behavioral/observer)
* State
* [Strategy](https://github.com/tirthalpatel/Learning-OOPD/tree/master/DesignPatterns/src/com/tirthal/learning/design/patterns/behavioral/strategy)
* Template Method
* Visitor

## Concurrency Patterns

Let you deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm.

To be added in future
